# Chess Overview
Welcome to chess!  This program is a simple chess game.  The program was implemented by a team of individuals: Mike Downs, Ben Painter, and Star Balls.  This game follows all the normal rules of chess. The only execption to this is that the king can put himself into check.  This program though can also do a few special moves: castling, empassent, and promotion (the promotion though is always to a queen).  This project was made for the purpose of practicing C++ and inheritance design.
