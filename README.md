# Chess Overview
Welcome to chess!  This program is a simple chess game.  The program was implemented by a team of individuals: Mike Downs, Ben Painter, and Star Balls.  This game follows all the normal rules of chess.  This program also does special moves like castling, empassent, and promotion (the promotion though is always to a queen).  This project was made for the purpose of practicing C++ and inheritance design.
